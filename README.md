# GUESS THE COLOUR GAME

## Background:

This game uses the RGB colour model. RGB stands for **red**, **green** and **blue**. The syntax is `rgb(num, num, num)` where num is a number from **0** to **255**, where 255 is either red, green or blue depending on the numbers position in the syntax. 

**Some examples include:**

|  RGB                  |  Colour   |

|`rgb(255, 0, 0)`       |     Red   |
|`rgb(0, 255, 0)`       |     Green  |
|`rgb(0, 0, 255)`       |     Blue |
